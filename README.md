# Ableton Homepage

## Sass Framework Project

As a musician, I'm a fan of Ableton's DAW software. As a web developer,
I was inspired by the homepage's format for their main articles!
I wanted to create the same postcard on a desk feeling while
still allowing for responsive design elements.

Tech used:
-Sass
-CSS Grid
-Flexbox

My aim in using Sass with this project was to start building partials
that would contribute to a personal, reusable css framework. My main
components include Nav Headers in flex box, grids for displaying articles,
and cards that fit inside the grid to display article header and text.
